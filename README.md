# Weather-API-Project
This project consists of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) derived from a python program I created. This program utilizes a Weather API for users to discover the minimum, maximum, and current daily temperatures of any city in the world.


Weather API Project:
The Weather API Project is a Python application that allows users to retrieve weather information for any city in the world. It utilizes a weather API to gather real-time weather data and provides a user-friendly interface for accessing and displaying the weather details.

Features:
- Fetches weather data from a weather API
- Supports querying weather information for any city globally
- Displays current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more
- Provides a command-line interface for easy interaction

Prerequisites:
Before running the program, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- requests library (pip install requests)

Usage: 
Follow the prompts and enter the name of the city to retrieve the weather information.

API Key:
To use the weather API, you need to obtain an API key from the provider. Update the API_KEY variable in the weather_app.py file with your own API key before running the program.
